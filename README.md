# Spider-robot

This project aims to explore how to design a cost-effective mobile sensor platform for high-risk environments.  Existing platforms can be high cost and highly specialised, requiring specially trained operators.  This report evaluates a robust mobile platform of my own creation that can continue to operate even with certain levels of damage and can be repaired locally. Because of the need for reparability, the large part of the construction technique used modular 3D printed parts and widely available hardware and software. The code was converted into an API, allowing the user to access data and configure the platform with ease. The results led to the conclusion of employing a spiderâ€™s form for stability, movement, and adaptability. The design has survivability characteristics, capable of being repaired in the field. It can be upgraded and updated.

Key words:  cost effective, mobile, sensor, reparability, modular, API, spider, survivability, easy to operate.
